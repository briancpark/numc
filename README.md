Here's what I did in project 4:
-

## Task 1
Implemented various functions. There were some conceptual challenges in understanding how slicing works, but turns out they're really represented as linked list of matrix structs and shifting memory pointers by offsets. Matrix operations were actually pretty straightfoward, and *much* easier compared to the matrix operations we had to implement in RISC-V assembly for project 2. Optimizations will be later applied once we learn parallelism!

## Task 2
Pretty simple, and straightforward. Skimming through the Python3 doc helped us solve the problem.
